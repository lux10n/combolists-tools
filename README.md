# combolists-tools
Toolkit for handling email:pass combolists. || Ensemble d'outils pour g√©rer les combolists email:pass

## USAGE

  **convert.sh <combolist_file>** : This tool will escape all hex characters from <combolist_file>, allowing other tools to run well.

  **validator.py <combolist_file> <result_file>** : This tool will read and extract all combos from <combolist_file> to <result_file>, creating a pure combolist from the given combolist.

  **email.py <combolist_file>** : This tool will read and extract all emails from <combolist_file> to the same file, creating a maillist from the given combolist.

  **cilter.py <maillist>** : This will sort all emails from <maillist> by domain and put them in the _Domains/_ folder. 
  
  For example, _"Domains/gmail.com"_ will contain emails like xxx@gmail.com, and _"Domains/comcast.net"_ will contain emails like xxx@comcast.net.
  
  **country.py** : This will sort all maillists in the _Domains_ folder by country.  
 
  Let's assume that the content of the _Domains_ folder contains the files _yahoo.co.uk, gmail.com, comcast.net, otakufr.com_.
  After running country.py, _"Domains"_ will contain folders like _Domains/com, Domains/uk and Domains/net_.
